## Getting Started

<!--
Provide step by step instructions that will allow a new contributor to get a copy of the project up and running on their local machine.
Installation of common development tools such as `git`, `docker` and IDEs can be covered here, but is not necessary.

The granularity and extent of these instructions will depend on the size and type of the project,
but may extend to things such as platform specific steps, etc.
-->

### Running the project

<!-- Provide examples of how to run the project locally here, if applicable. -->
<!-- If the project can be run in multiple ways (Docker, Minishift, command line, etc), -->
<!-- it might be appropriate to have a section for each of them-->

## Deployment

<!-- Provide step by step instructions that explain the process of deploying the application in QA or Prod environments -->

<!-- If the project uses a CI/CD pipeline describe the high level concepts of the pipeline strategy here. -->
