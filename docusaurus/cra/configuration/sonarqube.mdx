A SonarQube analyzation job is included in the GitLab pipeline.
To set this up, we'll need to create a project in SonarQube, and a token.

First, we need to [create a new project in SonarQube](https://sonarqube.intility.no/projects/create).

![New Project in SonarQube](/img/sonarqube-new.png)  
The project key should be the same as the project slug from GitLab.

:::note
If you use something other than the GitLab project slug,
you'll need to modify the `SONAR_PROJECT` variable in the top of the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
:::

Then in the next step, either generate a new token, or select an existing one.  
![Generate Token](/img/sonarqube-token.png)  
Copy the token and [add it to GitLab CI/CD variables](/cra/configuration/gitlab#adding-cicd-variables) with the key `SONAR_TOKEN`.

## Badge

Due to intility's sonarqube domain being private, retrieving badge directly from that domain would not work.

Therefore you will need to retrieve your project badges from this proxy: `sonarqube-badge-proxy.apps.openshift.intility.com/badges/`

On your project dashboard in gitlab select the following from the navigation drawer `Settings > General > Badges`

![Badge settings in gitlab](/img/sonarqube-badge-settings.png)

The proxy works as the following `sonarqube-badge-proxy.apps.openshift.intility.com/badges/<your-sonarqube-project-name>/<badge-type>` and the following badge types are available:

 - `maintainability`
 - `bugs`
 - `code_smells`
 - `duplications`
 - `ncloc`
 - `quality_gate`
 - `reliability`
 - `security`
 - `debt`
 - `vulnerabilities`

You will have to replace badge image url using your sonarqube project name and desired badge type e.g `sonarqube-badge-proxy.apps.openshift.intility.com/badges/cool-portal/bugs`

The badge will be rendered in preview if configured correctly as such

:::note
You can also embed badges in readme by using any of the following markdown syntaxes
`[![Description](proxy-badge-image-url)](url-to-your-project)` or 
`![Description](proxy-badge-image-url)`
