title: Upgrade to V1 pipeline
sidebar_position: 5
---

If you created a project with an earlier version of this template, you can follow this guide to simply upgrade it.
This guide assumes you haven't made any changes to the earlier pipeline.

## Features

- Helm chart
- Docker image pushed to GCR
- Parallelized jobs (pipeline usually takes ~2m)

## OpenShift

When switching to the new pipeline, it will automatically create new resources.
At a minimum, you should delete the existing route, as the old one will crash with the new one.
However, it's recommended to start blank, by either clearing out or re-creating the existing project, or by creating a new project.

## Create Deploy Token

The new pipeline publishes a docker image to GitLab Container Registry, and uses Helm to create resources in OpenShift.
As a result, OpenShift needs access to pull images from GCR.

In your GitLab repository, go to Settings -> Repository -> Deploy tokens.
Create a new token named `gitlab-deploy-token`, and give it the `read_registry` scope.

That's all you have to do in the repository.
The token is exposed as a variable in the pipeline, and helm applies it as a pull secret in OpenShift.
Read more about GitLab deploy tokens [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/#gitlab-deploy-token).

## Edit `index.ts`

The new pipeline doesn't use a `REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable in the pipeline,
so we need to change `auth.redirectUri` in our MSAL Config.

```js title=index.ts
const msal = {
  auth: {
    // This is the new value of redirectUri
    redirectUri: window.location.origin
  }
};
```

## Copy files

Download the contents of [this repository](https://gitlab.intility.com/herman/cra-pipeline-upgrade) ([direct zip download](https://gitlab.intility.com/herman/cra-pipeline-upgrade/-/archive/main/cra-pipeline-upgrade-main.zip)).
Copy all files except `README.md` to your project, and push the changes.

The new pipeline should now take effect. Should any problems occur, ask a question in `#programming` on Slack.
