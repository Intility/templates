The template comes packed with a pipeline, that builds, tests, analyzes and deploys your API.

## Jobs

:::info
The `image:dev` and `image:prod` jobs is set to run on pushes to `master` or `main` branch.
:::

:::info
The `image:prod` and `deploy:prod` jobs are set to run when tags are pushed to the repository.
:::

### `build`

Builds the project, and creates a build artifact for later stages to use.

### `test`

Runs the tests in the project.
Runs parallel with `build`.

### `analyze`

Analyzes the project with sonar-scanner.
Runs parallel with `build`.

### `image`

Uses the artifact from the `build` step, and creates and publish a docker image with the `Dockerfile.CI` file using kaniko.
Runs once the `build` job has finished.

### `deploy`

Deploys the application to OpenShift using the Helm chart.
Runs once the `image` and `test` jobs have succeeded.

## Debugging the pipeline

### Paths
Ensure the paths used are right.
In the `build` step, we need to ensure that we are working from the right folder.

```yml title='.gitlab-ci.yml'
build:
  script:
    - dotnet restore
    - cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER # cd to the project folder
    - dotnet publish -o build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER/build # the build in the project folder
```

In `image:dev`, we need the `context` parameter to be set to the project folder.

```yml title='.gitlab-ci.yml'
image:dev:
  script:
    - echo ...
    - /kaniko/executor
      --context $CI_PROJECT_DIR/YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER # sets the context to your project folder
```

In `deploy:dev`, ensure the path to the chart is right.

```yml title='.gitlab-ci.yml'
deploy:dev:
  script:
    - oc login $OPENSHIFT_SERVER --token=$OPENSHIFT_TOKEN
    - helm upgrade
      --install $CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER/chart # path to chart
```
