The project comes included with error reporting to Sentry, and a pipeline job to upload sourcemaps and create releases.
To set this up, we'll need to create a project in Sentry and retrieve the project DSN.

## Create Project

Head over to the [Create a new Project page in Sentry](https://sentry.intility.no/organizations/intility/projects/new/).

![Sentry Platform Select](/img/sentry-new-dotnet.png)  
Under platform, select .NET.

![Sentry New Project Name](/img/sentry-new-name-dotnet.png)  
For the project name, use the project slug from GitLab.
If you use something other than the project slug
you'll need to modify the `SENTRY_PROJECT` variable in the top of the .gitlab-ci.yml file.  
Select a fitting team, or create a new one, and hit Create.

You'll be taken to a Configure .NET page.
In the code examples, copy the DSN value passed to `Sentry.Init`, and [add it to GitLab CI/CD variables](/dotnet/setup/gitlab#adding-cicd-variables) with the key `SENTRY_DSN`.
