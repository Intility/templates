Every feature exposes configuration through the standard dotnet core configuration infrastructure. This lets you, as the developer, 
to decide how to provide those configurations. Usually through the `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json` on your local 
machine or through environment variables or secrets in CI or production environments.

Read more about available configuration providers in the official dotnet documentation.

⚠️ **TODO**:

* App Registrations
* The relationship between SPA App, Resource App 
* How to configure them properly
--- 

```json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    // azure identity platform instance (should not be changed)
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    // primary domain of your tenant
    "Domain": "intility.onmicrosoft.com",
    // tenant / directory id
    "TenantId": "9b5ff18e-53c0-45a2-8bc2-9c0c8f60b2c6",

## Swagger

---
⚠️ **TODO**:

* Swagger authentication
* Swagger versioning relationship with API versioning
---

```json
{
  "Swagger": {
    // Name of the service in Swagger definition and UI
    "AppName": "Company.WebApplication1 Swagger",

    // The client id to authenticate with. This should be an
    // app registration with delegated permission to the API registration
    "ClientId": "22222222-2222-2222-22222222222222222"
  }
}
```

## Logging

Logging is provided by the external package `Intility.Logging.AspNetCore` in conjunction with logger sink extensions. The goal with the external package is to enable 
continuous development of logging support centrally, as the infrastructure changes over time, alleviating you of this burden.
