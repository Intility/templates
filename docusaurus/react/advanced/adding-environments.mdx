title: Adding Environments
sidebar_position: 1
---

The included pipeline contains jobs for `dev` and `prod` environments.
Here we'll talk about enabling, using and adding more environments.

## Enabling the `deploy:prod` job

The provided `deploy:prod` job is disabled by default.
This is to force you to make an active choice on wether you want to use the job or [ArgoCD](/react/advanced/deploy-argocd).

To enable the job, simply remove the `.` from the last job.

```diff title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
- .deploy:prod:
+ deploy:prod:
```

### Trigger production jobs

To trigger the production jobs, simply run

```shell
npm version [major|minor|patch]
git push --tags
```

This will update the `version` field in `package.json`,
update the `appVersion` field in `chart/Chart.yaml`,
and create a git tag with the version.

After all the other jobs has completed, we can manually trigger the `deploy:prod` job.
This is manual by design, and shouldn't be set to automatic.

### Separate OpenShift project

You can, and should create a separate OpenShift project to host the production environment.

To do this, simply follow the [same steps as earlier](/react/configuration/deploy).
This time, name it `aa-<project-slug>-prod`.
When adding the `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN` to CI/CD variables, select `prod` as the Environment scope.
This variable will then be used instead of the default one in the `deploy:prod` job.

:::note
If you can't see the `prod` environment when creating a variable,
you need to trigger the production jobs first.
The `build:prod` job will then provision the `prod` environment,
and you can insert the `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN` before triggering the deploy job.

## Adding even more Environments

Usually, a development and a production environment is enough.
In big applications however, you might see the need for more environments.

In this example, we will set up a QA environment.
To do this, we will simply copy the `prod` jobs, and create our own for `qa` instead.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
build:qa:
  extends: build:dev
  environment:
    name: qa
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_TAG'

image:qa:
  extends: image:dev
  variables:
    IMAGE_TAG: qa
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_TAG'
  needs: ['build:qa']

sentry:qa:
  extends: sentry:dev
  variables:
    SENTRY_ENV: qa
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_TAG'
  needs: ['build:qa']

.deploy:qa:
  extends: deploy:dev
  variables:
    ROUTE: $CI_PROJECT_NAME-qa.apps.int.intility.no
  environment:
    name: qa
    url: https://$CI_PROJECT_NAME-qa.apps.int.intility.no
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_TAG'
  needs: ['test', 'image:qa']
```

:::note
We don't override the Sentry release and the image version,
to avoid version collisions with the production jobs.
:::

This example will, like the production jobs, be triggered by git tags.
But it will automatically deploy it to the QA environment,
which will be created in the default OpenShift project,
unless you've created a custom QA project.
