The project comes included with error reporting to Sentry, and a pipeline job to upload sourcemaps and create releases.
To set this up, we'll need to create a project in Sentry, the project DSN and an auth token.

### Create Project

Head over to the [Create a new Project page in Sentry](https://sentry.intility.no/organizations/intility/projects/new/).

![Sentry Platform Select](/img/sentry-new-platform.png)  
Under platform, select React.

![Sentry New Project Name](/img/sentry-new-name.png)  
For the project name, use the project slug from GitLab.
Select a fitting team, or create a new one, and hit Create.

:::note
If you use something other than the GitLab project slug
you'll need to modify the `SENTRY_PROJECT` variable in the top of the .gitlab-ci.yml file.  
:::

You'll be taken to a Configure React page.
In the code example under Connecting the SDK to Sentry, copy the `dsn` value, and [add it to GitLab CI/CD variables](/react/configuration/gitlab#adding-cicd-variables) with the key `SENTRY_DSN`.

### Acquire Token

Go to the [Auth Token section of your Account Settings](https://sentry.intility.no/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/).

![Create Sentry Token](/img/sentry-token.png)
The needed scopes are `project:read`, `project:releases` and `org:read`.

Create it, copy the token and [add it to GitLab CI/CD variables](/react/configuration/gitlab#adding-cicd-variables) with the key `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`.
