## `build`

The main `build` job runs [`vite build`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli.html#build) on every push to all branches (except master).
It will pass some default environment variables;

- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` will be [`SENTRY_ENV`](/react/configuration/sentry#acquire-token)
- `VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` will be the git branch name
- `VITE_SENTRY_RELEASE` will be the git commit SHA

It also creates an artifact of the `build` folder that is created,
which will be passed onto later jobs.

The `build:*` pipeline does the same as build,
except it adds a GitLab environment.
The base job uses the GitLab environment name to configure the Sentry environment.

## `sonarqube`

This job uses the [SonarScanner CLI](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/) to upload the source code to SonarQube.
The pipeline will continue if this job fails, but it should be looked into.

## `image`

The image jobs builds a docker image with the `Dockerfile.CI` dockerfile,
and with the build output from the `build` jobs.

For the `image:dev` job, it pushes two tags, one with `dev`, and one with the pipeline id.
For the `image:prod` job, the tags pushed are `latest` and the tag name.

## `sentry`

The `sentry` job uses the [Sentry CLI](https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/) to create a new release.
The release name will be the git commit SHA.
It will connect the release to the current commit, and upload sourcemaps from the build step.
Lastly it will associate the release with the right env.

## `deploy`

This is the main job for deploying to OpenShift.  
It will create an environment in GitLab, with the URL to the running app.

It uses Helm to install the app to an OpenShift project.

For `deploy:dev`, the route defaults to `https://{projectSlug}-dev.apps.int.intility.no`.  
For `deploy:prod`, the route defaults to `https://{projectSlug}.apps.int.intility.no`.
