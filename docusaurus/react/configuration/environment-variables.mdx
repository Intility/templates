Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files.
By default you will have `import.meta.env.MODE` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with `VITE_`.

By default, a `.env.development` file is included, which will be loaded when you run your app locally.

For more information, please read the [Env Variables and Modes](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) section of the Vite docs.
