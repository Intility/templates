Intility React TypeScript template for Vite.

When you normally run create-vite, you get a great simple starting point for developing React locally.
However, the next steps are not instantly clear.
Where do I get the Intility favicon?
Which router should I use?
Do I have to make the styles myself?
How and where can I deploy it?

These very opinionated templates aims to give developers battle-tested sane defaults for Intility projects using React.

## Vite

Vite is the main part of the development environment, these docs only covers the Intility template part of it.
This means that everything from the official [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) applies to your project.
If you can't find what your looking for here, check the Vite docs.
