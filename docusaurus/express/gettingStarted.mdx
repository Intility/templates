## Scaffolding the project

```bash
npm install -g yo                           # Install Yeoman CLI
npm install -g @intility/generator-express  # Install Intility Express project generator

mkdir <projectName> && cd <projectName>     # Create a new project folder
yo @intility/express                        # Use Yeoman CLI to run the template generator
```

:::info
During the project scaffolding you will be asked the following questions:
1. **Project name and description**
    - These values will be injected into the `package.json` file and will also ble shown in the Swagger documentation.
    - Default project name will be the name of the folder.
2. Do you want to include **demo endpoints** in the generated project?
    - This is recommended for first time setup or if you are not familiar with Express API architecture 
    - These files provides example CRUD operations with a router-, controller- and service-layer
3. **Automatic Git initialization** and push to given Git repository.
    - Please [create a GitLab](https://gitlab.intility.com/projects/new?namespace_id=978#blank_project) project, and get the SSH key. 
    - NOTE: Unselect the: 'Initialize repository with a README' under 'Project Configuration'
:::

:::info
During dependency installation stage of the project initialization it may be shown an error message for missing Python or C++ compiler.

**Please ignore this error message**

## Running the project

After the project have successfully been scaffolded you are ready to start the server.

```bash
code .                                  # Open project in VS Code
npm run start                           # Start the project
```

After starting the project an `Missing Environment variable: INTILITY_TENANT_ID` Error will ber thrown. 
To fix this, create an `.env` file by using the template provided in `.env.template` and setup authentication by following this ([Guide](./setup/ApplicationRegistrations))

For an more comprehensive overview of all included Npm Scripts, have a look at this page: [NPM Scripts](./NpmScripts)

## What should I do next?

* Generate SonarQube Token ([Guide](https://create.intility.app/cra/configuration/sonarqube))
  * Add the badge ([Guide](https://gitlab.intility.com/digital-telco/sonarqube/sonarqube-badge-proxy/-/blob/master/README.md))
* Add Code coverage regexp to Gitlab to make the badge work.
  * Navigate to: `GitLab Repository -> Settings -> CI/CD -> General pipelines -> Test coverage parsing`
  * Enter: `All files[^|]*\|[^|]*\s+([\d\.]+)`
* Create an `.env` file by using the template provided in `.env.template`
  * Setup authentication ([Guide](./setup/ApplicationRegistrations))
* Setup your OpenShift environment:
  * Create a project on OpenShift ([Guide](https://create.intility.app/cra/configuration/deploy))
  * Create a Deploy Token for your GitLab Repository ([Guide](https://create.intility.app/cra/configuration/gitlab#add-gitlab-deploy-token))
