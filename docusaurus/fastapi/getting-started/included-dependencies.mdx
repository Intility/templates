## pre-commit

Pre-commit is a code-checker that will run every time you attempt to commit any changes.
It runs different programs, such as .flake8, black etc.,
all of which can be configured individually through either config files or the ``pyproject.toml``.

:::info pre-commit
When pre-commit changes something,
you must add the modified file before you rerun pre-commit. It only runs on files staged for commit.
