### Intility ``Cruft``
You'll need [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) in order to use this template.
```bash
python -m pip install cruft
```

## Create FastAPI App

Use ``cruft`` to start your project.

```bash
python -m cruft create https://github.com/Intility/templates.git --directory="fastapi"
```

A few questions you will be prompted, here with a more verbose description:

* ``full_name``: Required for ``pyproject.toml``
* ``email``: Required for ``pyproject.toml``
* ``project_name``: The folder name, and required for ``pyproject.toml``. Keep it short and simple!
* ``description``: Required for ``pyproject.toml``
* ``sqlmodel``: An ORM for ``FastAPI``. Select ``1`` if you need a database. This will create example APIs,
install ``alembic`` for migrations, add ``postgres`` to the ``docker-compose`` file etc.
* ``authentication_strategy``: Every API _must_ have authentication through Azure AD, but which strategy you chose is
up to you. The options are:
  * ``FastAPI Azure Auth (default)``: Authentication and authorization is done in your FastAPI
  application. This is the default and recommended authentication strategy, which this tutorial will assume you chose.
  Under the hood, this uses [``fastapi-azure-auth``](https://github.com/Intility/fastapi-azure-auth),
  a library written and maintained by Intility.
  * ``Kong (no auth included)``: The alternative is to use Kong. This removes all authentication
  from your FastAPI application, and assume you host your application behind Kong. This tutorial will not cover this
  strategy.
* ``include_example_apis``: Chose whether you want example APIs and tests to be included in the generated files.
  If this is the first time using this template, **select ``true``**.

You'll now have a new folder, matching your `project_name`.
