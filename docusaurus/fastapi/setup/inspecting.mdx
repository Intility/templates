Now that we have a running application, we can head over and check out our OpenAPI documentation, and confirm that
Azure AD Authentication works.

Run the application, either through
[``poetry``](/fastapi/setup/poetry#running-the-server) or through
[PyCharm](/fastapi/setup/pycharm#configuring-pycharm-to-run-the-server).

Head over to `http://localhost:8000/docs`. Here you'll see your API documentation, generated automatically from
``pydantic`` models. Try clicking on an API and try it out:

![Testing out an API](/img/fastapi/setup/1_inspect_openapi.png)

As we can see, the response body is:

```json
{
  "detail": "Not authenticated"
}
```

This is because this specific API view requires authentication. Click the `Authorize` button, leave the `client_secret` blank, and authorize.

Log in through Azure AD, and try out the API again, and it should work.

The next API, `api/v1/hello-admin` requires the user to have the `AdminUser` role. You can read more about roles
in the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/),
and how to lock down views on them in the [`FastAPI-Azure-Auth` documentation](https://intility.github.io/fastapi-azure-auth/single-tenant/locking_down_on_roles).
