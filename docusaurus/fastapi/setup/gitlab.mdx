Go to [New Project in GitLab](https://gitlab.intility.com/projects/new).

Select a fitting name; it should be as globally unique and descriptive for your project as possible.

Take note of the Project Slug, as we'll use it later to configure the project in Sentry and OpenShift.

## Pushing your application

Creating a FastAPI project from a template does not automatically create a git repository for you,
so we have to make one ourselves.

:::info pre-commit
Remember, we use pre-commit, so we'll have to initiate that before we try to commit!
:::

Follow the "Push an existing folder" example, but mix in pre-commit. The commands should look like this:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin git@gitlab.intility.no:Group/intility-api.git
git checkout -b main
pre-commit install  # <--- This is an important step
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Sometimes checks will fail, or some files might be modified (by e.g. ``black``).
When this happens, add the modified files and try again:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

Later, when you have made changes to your code, other checks may fail. These checks can be anything from missing
docstrings, leftover prints etc. If you want to ignore checks, you can typically do so globally in the configuration files,
or the line where the check fail. How to configure these checks will vary, so spend some time to get familiar with the tools.

If you want to ignore ``pre-commit`` checks, you can use the ``--no-verify`` flag when committing:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit" --no-verify
```
