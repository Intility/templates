### Docker-compose

:::info
Only projects that are generated with SQLModel will will have a ``docker-compose.yaml`` file.
:::

`docker-compose` is configured to run docker images such as redis for your development server, and for tests.
Before we can run these containers, we need to configure our environment variables.

Head over to your `.env` file and fill in the remaining values (highlighted). These are only for development use,
but it is still recommended to generate a secure password.

:::warning
Your password should not contain slashes (`/`), since these passwords are used in connection strings.
You can generate passwords by using this command: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
:::

```bash title=".env" {13}
# Basics
ENVIRONMENT=dev

# Sentry
SENTRY_DSN=

# Authentication
TENANT_ID=9b5ff18e-53c0-45a2-8bc2-9c0c8f60b2c6
APP_CLIENT_ID=
OPENAPI_CLIENT_ID=

# Only needed if you selected SQLModel
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
````

Then, run docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
