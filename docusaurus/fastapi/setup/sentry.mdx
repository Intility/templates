The project comes included with error reporting to Sentry and a pipeline job to upload sourcemaps and create releases.
To set this up, we'll need to create a project in Sentry and retrieve the project DSN.

## Create Project

Head over to the [Create a new Project page in Sentry](https://sentry.intility.no/organizations/intility/projects/new/).

![Sentry Platform Select](/img/fastapi/setup/sentry_asgi.png)
Under platform, select ``ASGI``

![Sentry New Project Name](/img/sentry-new-name-dotnet.png)  
For the project name, use the project slug from GitLab.
Select a fitting team, or create a new one, and hit Create.

You'll be taken to a Configure ASGI page.
In the code examples, copy the DSN value passed to `sentry_sdk.init`, and add it to your `.env` file under `SENTRY_DSN`:

```bash title=".env" {5}
# Basics
ENVIRONMENT=dev

# Sentry
SENTRY_DSN=

# Authentication
TENANT_ID=9b5ff18e-53c0-45a2-8bc2-9c0c8f60b2c6
APP_CLIENT_ID=
OPENAPI_CLIENT_ID=

# Databases, cache etc.
# Only needed if you selected SQLModel
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
````
