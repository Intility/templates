# [Project Title]

<!-- Describe the project briefly here. -->
<!-- Also, unless it's clear: specify what type of project it is; API, library, application, collection of scripts, etc -->

This project was bootstrapped with the [Intility React Template](https://github.com/Intility/templates/).

## Purpose

<!-- What does the application do and why? What problem does it solve? -->

## Intended consumers

<!--  Who is the application intended for, and who can utilize its features? -->

## Main technologies

React

<!-- What are the main languages and frameworks are used in the project -->

## Available at

<!-- If the application is live, mention where it can be 'viewed' and where it is deployed, e.g. OpenShift, Azure etc. -->
<!-- For libraries, this might also include what package repository it's available at -->
<!-- If the project is an API or a library, where can I find documentation for it? -->

## Getting Started

<!--
Provide step by step instructions that will allow a new contributor to get a copy of the project up and running on their local machine.
Installation of common development tools such as `git`, `docker` and IDEs can be covered here, but is not necessary.

The granularity and extent of these instructions will depend on the size and type of the project,
but may extend to things such as platform specific steps, etc.
-->

### Running the project

<!-- Provide examples of how to run the project locally here, if applicable. -->
<!-- If the project can be run in multiple ways (Docker, Minishift, command line, etc), -->
<!-- it might be appropriate to have a section for each of them-->

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

<!-- Provide step by step instructions that explain the process of deploying the application in QA or Prod environments -->

<!-- If the project uses a CI/CD pipeline describe the high level concepts of the pipeline strategy here. -->
